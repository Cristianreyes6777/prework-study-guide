# Orework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was developed as a prework foundation for the initiation of a Coding bootcamp. The study guide, the end product, was developed by using a rudimentary skillset in HTML, CSS, and Java. With the help of tools and resources provided by the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, the student (myself) was able to create a crude website.



## Installation

In order to get started, I reviewed the prework modules provided to me through Canvas. I carefully read the modules, followed the instructions, and was able to problem solve my way through the prework. Thee installation is based on simple HTML, CSS, and Java code implemented through the use of git, github, and VS code.

## Usage

The prework study guide was created in linear fashion. Simply review the notes from begioning to end in sequential order. For additional guidance, access the console on ChromeDev and you will see the list of topics covered.
